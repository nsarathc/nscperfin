Thanks for stopping by!

My friends and colleagues know me as **Sarath Chandra**, and address me by the first name: *Sarath*.  

By profession, I have been a Software Developer through a large part of my career spanning a couple of decades.  By virtue of accumulated industry experience and product development knowledge, I am currently leading a product development team building a highly complex application system.

Personally, I believe I am a permanent student.  I love to read a variety of topics - technology,  problem solving methods, software architecture, system development, leadership, personal finance, business strategy, photography and current affairs (not necessarily in the same order).  When I watch Television, that usually will be T-20 Cricket Match, or a similar sporting event.  

I wanted to maintain my observations, learnings and other useful stuff  in the form of a blog, and built this site using  **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].  I may not write a lot on my own, but promise myself to pick up and share helpful links to simplify a newbie programmer's life (they are the ones that I spend a lot of my time with, so!).
